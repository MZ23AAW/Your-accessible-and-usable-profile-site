      <p>Cybersecurity has always been an area of significant interest to me, particularly as our world becomes increasingly digital. As the number of cyber threats continues to rise, I am fascinated by how we can develop systems, policies, and technologies to protect sensitive data and ensure the safety of users online. From defending against hacking attempts to securing critical infrastructures, cybersecurity is crucial in ensuring the trustworthiness of digital systems.</p>
      <p>My interest in cybersecurity spans multiple domains, including network security, ethical hacking, cryptography, and secure software development. I have worked on projects that focus on penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and encryption techniques, which further fuel my passion for understanding and mitigating security risks. I am keen to develop solutions that proactively address emerging security threats and contribute to making the digital world safer for everyone.</p>

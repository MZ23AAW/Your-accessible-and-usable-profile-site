      <p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
      <p>During my first year at the University of Hertfordshire, I created this app. The objective was to develop an application that would assist users with two essential tasks: finding accessible parking spots and managing their medications/appointments. It sought to solve practical issues that persons with disabilities frequently encounter, making sure they have the resources necessary to obtain both necessary medical care and mobility aids.</p>

      <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medication tracking with notifications to remind users when to take their medication.</li>
        <li>During the project's early phases, I researched the key aspects needed to create a user-friendly GUI and assure effective design. To understand how the GUI should function, we used the usability document developed by our team leader as a starting point. I designed a logo,  GP appointment schedule page and an emergency contact form so that my colleagues could see how the GUI would look.</li>
        <li>Location base searches for disability parking spaces that are nearby.</li>
        <li>User-friendly interface designed for ease of use by individuals with varying levels of tech literacy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Role in the Project:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Graphical User Interface Designer</li>
        <li>Researcher</li>

      </ul>
